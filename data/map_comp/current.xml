    <description>The dead are rising from their graves to attack the living! For this competition, you are tasked with creating a Zombie Survival scenario involving any setting or time period of your choice. From WW1 soldiers defending their trench against hordes of the ravenous dead, to special forces teams trying to contain a zombie outbreak in a lab, to medieval knights defending their castle against a brain-hungry army, to whatever scenario you can conceivably imagine that pitches the player against the walking dead.</description>
